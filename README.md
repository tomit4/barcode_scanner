### A basic barcode scanner using zxing browser library

A very simple proof of concept for scanning pdf417 docs using [zxing browser library](https://github.com/zxing-js/browser).

In order to better understand the output of the scanned pdf417 document on driver's license, I ahve included the AAMVA's standard on Driver's License ID Design Standards. Specifically search for D.12.5 Data Elements within the PDF document to get the specifications on the fields.
